	"During the analysis of my latest generation of machines, I noticed that they often won't use the best way of crafting, or that they waste material remains",
	"Through minimal adaptations of their program, I made it so they can analyse and document their own efficiency. The data created in that way are stored as \"Support\"-points inside the machine.",
	"I can probably evaluate the gathered data sets of these \"intelligently\" working machines in my own further research, or use them to create even more intelligent machinery.",
	"If supplied with Support-points, I can also use the assembly table to build considerably better components.",
	"Info: The Supportgauge is (most of the time) on the right-hand side of machinery GUI's, and is yellow-colored. Information regarding transport and storage of such points can be found on the \"logistics\"-page.",
	"Note: New researchables available in \"logistics\"!",
